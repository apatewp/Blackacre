# Blackacre

Blackacre, like its cousin [Blackstone](https://github.com/ICLRandD/Blackstone), is a spaCy model and library for processing long-form, unstructured legal text.
Unlike Blackstone, Blackacre is tweaked for U.S. legal text. Furthermore, Blackacre comes with a performant API layer written in Go.

**NOTE: Blackacre is seriously feature-incomplete at the moment. Tis a work in progress. Stay tuned!!**
